    "# Guessing the author of a novel, 太宰治 or 宮沢賢治?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement a method that guesses who wrote a novel of an unknown author, 太宰治 (Osamu Dazai) or 宮沢賢治 (Kenji Miyazawa).\n",

    "In this project, we use texts from [Aozora Bunko](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/index.html).\n",
    "We have modified the texts by removing rubies and notes written by those who typed the texts.\n",
    "We have also adjusted the number of novels by 太宰治 so that\n",
    "the total numbers of letters in novels of the two authors are nearly equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide 81 novels by 太宰治, 148 novels by 宮沢賢治, and 10 novels by unknown authors.\n",
    "Observe the characteristics of the texts by 太治宰 and 宮沢賢治, and for each of the novels by unknown authors,\n",
    "guess who wrote it, 太宰治 or by 宮沢賢治.\n",
    "Among the known features for classifying texts, try to use statistical features of letter n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the novels by 宮沢賢治, sentences tend to end with the です-ます style.\n",
    "On the other hand, in the novels by 太宰治, sentences tend to end with the である style.\n",
    "Therefore, given that the bi-grams in the novels by each author have been counted,\n",
    "the probability of occurrences of `です` or ` す。` should be high in the novels by 宮沢賢治,\n",
    "and that of `ある` or `る。` should be high in those by 太宰治.\n",
    "If the probability of `です` or ` す。` in the novel by an unknown author is higher than that of `ある` or `る。`,\n",
    "you can then conclude that the author is 宮沢賢治.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some novels by 宮沢賢治 are written in the です-ます style.\n",
    "Therefore, compute the probability distribution of all the letter n-grams of each of the authors,\n",
    "and observe the similarity between the probability distribution of letter n-grams of an unknown author\n",
